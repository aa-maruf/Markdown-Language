# 🖐️ Hellooo!

> ###  This repl is for describing handy features, tips & tricks of replit. Also, I have discussed about [markdown language](https://replit.com/@MARUF41/Replit-101-1#.tutorial) here.

### In replit,  we can create \.tutorial folder where we store tutorials like documents, videos, images & drawing. 


#### 🤜For written contents, file name will end with .md (markdown document).

#### 🤜For videos we use \.json at the end of file name.

#### 🤜we can create \.draw file where we can [draw](https://replit.com/@MARUF41/Replit-101-1#Drawing%20Folder.draw).
