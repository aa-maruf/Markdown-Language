# 🖐️ Hellooo!

> ###  This repl is for describing [markdown language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown "Wikipedia-about mardown language") . All the information on markdown language that I know are explained in the markdown tutorial file (inside \.tutorial folder). 
> 
### Also this is written in markdown language too. [This is my code link](https://replit.com/@MARUF41/Replit-101-1#.tutorial "Replit Link").


### I used replit as code editor. In replit,  we can create \.tutorial folder to store tutorials like documents, videos, images & drawing. 


  ####    🤜For written contents, file name will end with \.md (markdown document).

  ####    🤜For videos we use \.json at the end of file name.

  ####    🤜we can create \.draw file for drawing.

### Thank you 🙂
