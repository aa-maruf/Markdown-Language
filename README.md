# 🖐️ Hellooo!

> ###  This repl is for describing [markdown language](https://replit.com/@MARUF41/Replit-101-1#.tutorial"Replit Link") here. All the information on markdown language that I know are explained in the markdown tutorial file (inside \.tutorial folder). 
> 
###I have written this document using markdown language. [This is my code link] (https://replit.com/@MARUF41/Replit-101-1#.tutorial"Replit Link").


### I used replit as code editor. In replit,  we can create \.tutorial folder to store tutorials like documents, videos, images & drawing. 


#### 🤜For written contents, file name will end with \.md (markdown document).

#### 🤜For videos we use \.json at the end of file name.

#### 🤜we can create \.draw file where we can draw.

### Thank you 🙂
